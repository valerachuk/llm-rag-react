## Overview

This document explores additions to the Security reports and to the database schemas
that would enable new features for Dependency Scanning and License Scanning.

The solutions being considered are:
- adding tables to the PostgreSQL primary database (schema change)
- creating a new PostgreSQL database (new schema)
- storing new documents in Object Storage
- indexing data in ElasticSearch
- caching data in Redis

Most sections of this document are organized in three parts:
1. feature: What do users need?
1. technical discussion: How can we implement the feature? What are the technical constraints, and how can we satisfy them?
1. proposal: What is the corresponding DB schema or document schema?

This document contains a simplified proposal that should be used when implementing new features.
As such, it might skip implementation details, like the exact Foreign Key constraints we would add to the relational DB.

## Dependency search

Users want to search project dependencies:
- for a specific package name; they might also specify a package type and a version number to refine the search
- for packages that use a given license
- for packages that are affected by a given vulnerability

The scope of the search can either be:
- a single project
- a project group/namespace
- a GitLab instance

The search result is a list of packages that match the query along with the projects that depend on these.

In a first version the search is limited to the default branch.
Later on, it could be extended to all protected branches or to all project releases.

### Search for a package

Users want to know what package versions their projects use.
They might search project dependencies for:
- a package name
- a package name and a version number

When searching project dependencies, users might not know the non-canonical package names.
For instance, they might search for `django`, not realizing that `Django` is the canonical name for that Python package.
Also, `django` might be the dependency name used in their project, in the dependency file.

We need a DB table to efficiently query project dependencies by package name, type, and version.
We could have a `project_dependencies` table with:
- `smallint` column for the package type (integer values are interpreted by the Rails backend)
- `varchar` column for the package name
- `varchar` column for the package version
- composite index that combines all these columns, for performance

However, package names and versions would be repeated across project dependencies:
- Some packages are popular; many projects depend on them, and their names are repeated.
- This also applies to specific versions, and both the names and versions are repeated.
- In the future, the search won't be limited to the default branch, and branches of the same project are likely to repeat names and versions.

In order to save storage, we keep track of packages used as project dependencies in two separate tables:
- `packages` tracks packages by `type` and canonical `name`
- `package_versions` tracks versions by `package_id` and `version`

```sql
CREATE TABLE packages AS (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    type smallint NOT NULL,
    name varchar NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE package_versions AS (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    package_id integer NOT NULL,
    version varchar NOT NULL
);
```

To reduce storage, these tables can be cleaned up when packages or specific versions are no longer used as project dependencies.
This can be done when updating project dependencies, or in a periodically executing batch job.

Since `packages` and `package_versions` records are coming from the scanning jobs and these can't be trusted,
the [default scopes](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Base/default_scope/class) for the corresponding ActiveRecord models shouldn't return any objects.
In the future, these scopes could return all the packages and versions that match what's listed on trusted public package registries.

Since the `packages` table doesn't track the package source,
the same record might refer to a public package (fetched from the main registry) or to a private package.
This collision is not a problem since the goal is to enable efficient queries with a limited impact on storage,
and not to accurately track packages.

The canonical names stored in the DB might differ from the package names used in the dependency file.
The Rails backend normalizes the names before storing them in the `packages` table.
When processing a search query, the backend normalizes the given package names
so that they can be compared to the ones stored in the DB.
It might also make the search case-insensitive for convenience.
If needed, the exact package names used in the dependency files can be fetched from the Dependency Scanning report
and presented in the search result.

To support multi-project repositories, we need to track the paths to the dependency files where project dependencies were found,
and report these files in the search result. This supports the case where the same package manager is used
in different directories of the same GitLab project, like `client/Gemfile` and `server/Gemfile`.
Also, the file paths are likely to be repeated across projects,
and they should be stored in a separate DB table to reduce storage.

To avoid repeating the file paths across dependencies of the same project and across projects,
we track project dependencies using 2 tables:
- `dependency_files` tracks paths of dependency files.
- `project_dependencies` tracks package versions found in dependency files of projects.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dependency_files AS (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    package_type smallint NOT NULL,
    path varchar NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE project_dependencies AS (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp without time zone NOT NULL,
    dependency_file_id integer NOT NULL,
    package_version_id integer NOT NULL
);
```

Please note that in reality, package managers typically use two files to track project dependencies:
an editable dependency file, and a generated lock file,
but the Dependency Scanning analyzers and the report format they use only allow for one.
As a result, users might search for a path that isn't stored in the database, and get no results.
To address this, the Rails backend could convert the requested file path, or search for extra paths.
For instance, it could search for `client/Gemfile.lock` when users are searching for `client/Gemfile`.
In the future we could replace the `dependency_file_id` foreign key with a relation table
to track all the files that contribute to a set of dependencies,
or introduce a `dependency_file_sets` table that represents the sets.

By leveraging the `dependency_files` table, the backend can efficiently
list project dependencies that match a given file path or package type.

The `dependency_files` table can be cleaned up automatically, similar to `packages`.

Since `dependency_files` records are coming from the scanning jobs and these can't be trusted,
the default scope for the `DependencyFile` ActiveRecord model should only return objects
where the path matches a supported dependency file found in the root directory:
`Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, `package.json`, etc.
Custom filenames and dependency files found in sub-directories are excluded from the default scope.

Project dependencies are upserted when a new successful pipeline for the default branch
generates a new set of Dependency Scanning reports.
The backend upserts into the following database tables in this order:
1. `packages`
1. `package_versions`
1. `dependency_files`
1. `project_dependencies`

If a scanning job is retried, then the backend reprocesses the corresponding pipeline
as is this was a new one, to ensure data consistency.
It goes through the following steps:
1. List all the completed jobs of the pipeline. Jobs that have been retried are excluded.
1. Collect the Dependency Scanning reports of these jobs.
1. Process these reports, and do the upserts.

All the DB tables involved in tracking project dependencies
(`packages`, `package_versions`, `dependency_files`, and `project_dependencies`)
are stored in the primary DB
so that they can be efficiently joined when searching for specific packages
across a namespace that has a large number of projects, using PostgreSQL.
Moving project dependencies to a separate database would result in doing in-memory joins with too many project IDs.

### Search across protected branches and releases

Users want to search project dependencies across all protected branches and releases.

Protected branches and project releases are particular important because they usually correspond to:
- version branches under development or in maintenance mode
- releases being deployed and actively used

The names of the protected branches are stored in the `protected_branches.name` column,
and the git tags corresponding to the project releases are stored in `releases.tag`.
(These columns already exist in the DB schema of GitLab.)
Branch names and git tags are both git refs,
and so we store a "ref" that can either be a git tag or a branch.

To avoid repeating the same git ref across all dependencies that belong to the same project branch or release,
we introduce a new `project_dependency_sets` table that groups dependencies by ref.

```sql
CREATE TABLE project_dependency_sets (
  id integer NOT NULL,
  project_id integer NOT NULL,
  ref character varying NOT NULL
);
```

Project dependencies now belong to dependency sets.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies ADD COLUMN project_dependency_set_id NOT NULL;
```

Project dependencies no longer need to reference projects,
and the `project_id` column is removed to save space.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies DROP COLUMN project_id;
```

When doing this change, we first create dependency sets for the default branches of the existing projects,
and then add the existing dependencies to these sets.
Only then we can add a `NOT NULL` constraint to the `project_dependency_set_id` column;
this cannot be done when creating the column.

The upsert of project dependencies is changed so that dependency sets are also upserted.

### Navigate to scanning jobs

Users want to inspect the CI pipeline or CI job that reported a specific project dependency.

To keep track of the CI pipeline where a project dependency was detected,
we can leverage the `project_dependency_sets` table used to group dependencies detected in the same branch or release;
this avoids repeating the same pipeline ID across many project dependencies.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependency_sets ADD COLUMN pipeline_id;
```

The `pipeline_id` is set or updated when upserting project dependencies for a given git ref.

Alternatively, the concept of "dependency set" is changed, and a set now groups the dependencies detected by a single CI job.
This is more accurate, and users can be redirected to the exact job where a dependency was detected.
Also, this better supports the scenario where a CI job is retried, and the corresponding dependencies updated.
The upsert mechanism needs to be changed to upsert the multiple sets that correspond to the same ref.
Here are two ways this can be achieved:
- Track the job name in `project_dependency_sets.job_name`,
  and upsert dependencies that correspond to a project ID, ref, and job name.
- Move the `dependency_file_id` from the `project_dependencies` table to `project_dependency_sets`,
  and upsert dependencies that correspond to a project ID, ref, and file ID.

The latter is less coupled to the CI, and it results in a simpler logic where we upsert files, not files found in jobs.

When a branch is made protected, the last set of Dependency Scanning artifacts for that branch
(coming from the latest pipeline) should be processed, and project dependencies should be added to the relational DB.
This way project dependencies for the newly protected branch can be queried without having to wait for a new pipeline.

### Filter out development dependencies

Users want to exclude development dependencies when searching project dependencies.
They are not interested in the exact scope (Maven) or group (Bundler) these dependencies belong to.

A development dependency is a package that's _only_ used when developing the project or its dependencies.
This might be package only used for testing, linting, or debugging the project or the libraries it uses.

Package managers and build tools use different concepts to track how dependencies are used:
- npm and yarn distinguish between development dependencies and others.
- Maven puts dependencies into 5 scopes, and each scope has well-defined semantics.
- Bundler supports user-defined dependency groups. They are naming conventions but the semantics of a particular group might be unknown.

For the purpose of the search, the exact dependency group/scope is converted to a boolean value,
and then stored into the `development` column of the `project_dependencies` table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies ADD COLUMN development boolean;
```

`project_dependencies.development` is NULL when we can't establish whether this is a development dependency:
- The files processed by the analyzer don't provide the information.
- The semantics of the dependency group is unknown.

The exact dependency group or scope can be fetched from the reports and artifacts if/when needed.
In the future, if users need to filter project dependencies by dependency group,
then the following changes are needed:
- Create a DB table that tracks dependency groups without repeating their names. A group has name and package type, so that its name can be interpreted in the context of the package type.
- Add a `dependency_group_id` foreign key to the `project_dependencies` table, so that the backend can track the group of a project dependency. This column is NULL when the information is not available.
- Drop the existing `development` column, because it becomes redundant with the new `dependency_group_id` column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dependency_groups AS (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    package_type smallint NOT NULL,
    name varchar NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE project_dependencies ADD COLUMN dependency_group_id integer;
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies DROP COLUMN development;
```

Currently the Gemnasium analyzers don't track whether a package is a development dependency.
Most of the lock files and graph exports they parse don't provide the information,
and this information can't be stored in the Dependency Scanning reports.

### Search for dependencies using specific licenses

Users want to list project dependencies that use a specific license.

Licenses of project dependencies are already tracked in the `software_licenses` table.
It's currently used in combination of `software_license_policies` to set up a policy,
and allow or deny a license in the context of project.

`software_licenses` can be reused to track licenses detected in project dependencies.
A relation table is needed because a package version can have multiple licenses.

```sql
CREATE TABLE project_dependency_software_licenses AS (
    project_dependency_id integer NOT NULL,
    software_license_id integer NOT NULL
);
```

Please note that this model doesn't accurately track composite licenses.
For instance, it doesn't make the distinction between "MIT and BSD" and "MIT or BSD".
It's assumed that this distinction isn't needed when searching for dependencies matching a license.

By joining `project_dependencies` with `project_dependency_software_licenses` and `software_license_policies`,
it's possible to efficiently list dependencies with unapproved licenses.

To reduce storage, licenses that are no longer referenced by project dependencies or license policies should be removed.
This can be done when updating or destroying dependencies and policies, or in batch mode in a periodic job.

If we start collecting information about public packages (outside of user pipelines), including the licenses they use,
then `project_dependency_software_licenses` might repeat information stored in other tables.
However, this redundancy eliminates risks of collisions when the dependency is a private package whose name matches a public package.
In that particular case, licenses of a project dependency can differ from licenses of the corresponding public package.

### Search for dependencies affected by specific vulnerabilities

Users want to list project dependencies that are affected by a given vulnerability.

A project dependency might be affected by multiple vulnerabilities but a vulnerability belongs to a dependency.

Since vulnerabilities are tracked in the `vulnerability_occurrences` table,
we could add a `project_dependency_id` foreign key to link a vulnerability finding to a project dependency.
By adding that column, we can efficiently search for project dependencies matching a vulnerability,
and efficiently group vulnerabilities per dependency.

`project_dependency_id` would be NULL when the vulnerability has been reported by Dependency Scanning.

```sql
ALTER TABLE vulnerability_occurrences ADD COLUMN project_dependency_id;
```

However, this change would link a generic table used for all vulnerabilities to a table that is specific to Dependency Scanning.
If that's an issue, then we can load both project vulnerabilities and project dependencies in memory,
and leverage the vulnerability `location` to remove dependencies that don't match the requested vulnerability.

The backend already loads project vulnerabilities and project dependencies in memory,
and joins them when serving the dependency list, in order to group vulnerabilities per dependency.
However, project dependencies for the default branch would be fetched from the relational DB,
and not from a collection of Dependency Scanning reports.

### Search for newly added dependencies

Users want to list project dependencies that were recently added to the default branch or a protected branch.

Project dependencies detected in any given branch are upserted in the `project_dependencies` table.
The `created_at` column isn't touched when doing the upsert,
so it can be used to filter on dependencies recently added.

## Dependency policies

Users want to prevent specific packages from being added as project dependencies.
They might exclude specific package versions, or exclude the package altogether.

Package policies are tracked by introducing a `project_dependency_policies` relation table
that combines a project ID, a package ID, a classification, and a version range.
This table is similar to the existing `software_license_policies` table used to store license policies.

```sql
CREATE TABLE project_dependency_policies (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    project_id integer NOT NULL,
    package_id integer NOT NULL,
    classification integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
    version_range varchar DEFAULT '*'::varchar NOT NULL
);
```

We can leverage the relational DB to JOIN project dependencies with corresponding policies, based on the `project_id` and `package_id`.
However, the policies returned by the SQL query might not be a match,
and the Rails backend must evaluate the `version_range` to establish whether the policy applies to the package version being used a dependency.

`project_dependency_policies` could also be called `package_policies`.
This would be more consistent with the existing `software_license_policies` table
but wouldn't communicate that packages are used as project dependencies.

### Dependencies audit

Users want to know when specific packages were added as project dependencies.

Project dependencies detected in any given branch are upserted in the `project_dependencies` table.
The `created_at` column isn't touched when doing the upsert, so it reflects the time when a dependency was first detected.

If we need to know the exact commit where a project dependency was first introduced, then we need a new column in the `project_dependencies` table to store the SHA of that commit.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies ADD COLUMN first_commit_sha bytea NOT NULL;
```

The first commit could also be retrieved by storing the ID of the pipeline where a project dependency was first detected. However, we would need to access the CI database, and that should be avoided for performance reasons.

### Track changes in dependencies

When reviewing an MR, users want to review changes to project dependencies.

The Rails backend compares project dependencies between the source branch and the target branch,
and prepares a diff that's presented in the MR page.
This is similar to how newly-introduced and fixed vulnerabilities are presented in a MR.

Project dependencies being compared can be fetched from different data sources,
and the Rails backend uses the fastest option that's available:
1. fetch from the relational DB, if has the project dependencies
1. else load from the [internal Software of Bill of Materials](#internal-sbom) (SBoM) if available
1. else load from the collection of Dependency Scanning reports

Project dependencies all respond to the same interface so that they can be compared in the same way,
independently of the data source.

The internal SBoM (when supported) can be created dynamically when calculating the diff, acting as an intermediary cache.

The diff itself can also be cached to speed up the loading of the MR page.

## Dependency confusion protection

Users want to be warned about possible dependency confusion attacks.
These should be reported as vulnerability findings listed in the security dashboard of their projects.

### Reporting changes in package checksums

Users want to be warned when the checksum of a project dependency has changed
even though the package name, package version, and package source (if tracked) haven't changed.

Package checksums need to be reported by Dependency Scanning analyzers as part of the Dependency Scanning report.
Once checksums are made available to the Rails backend, they can be stored in the `project_dependencies` table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies ADD COLUMN checksum varchar;
```

Before upserting project dependencies when a CI pipeline finishes,
the backend fetches the current checksums from the `project_dependencies` table
and compares them to the checksums of the corresponding dependencies it has in memory (and about to be upserted).
It then creates vulnerability findings for each project dependency where the new checksum doesn't match the old one,
and eventually proceeds with the upsert.
The security check can be handled in a separate job so that it doesn't impact the upsert.

Checksums can't be stored in the `package_versions` table because:
- A package version can have multiple distributions, and each distribution can have multiple checksums.
- A package distribution can have multiple checksums corresponding to different hashing algorithms, like MD5 and SHA1.
- `packages` and `packages_versions` don't track the package source,
  and there might be a collision between a public package and a private one.

Since the backend simply compares checksums, it doesn't matter that `project_dependencies` doesn't track the package source.

### Reporting a change of package source

Users want to be warned when the source of a project dependency has changed.
In particular, they want to be notified when the package used to be fetched from a private registry,
and is now fetched from a public registry.

Package sources need to be reported by Dependency Scanning analyzers as part of the Dependency Scanning report.
Once the sources are made available to the Rails backend, their URLs can be stored in a new `package_sources` table.
so that they can be reused across projects dependencies.

```sql
CREATE TABLE package_sources AS (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    url varchar NOT NULL
);
```

A new `package_source_id` column is added to track the source from which a dependency has been fetched.
This column might be NULL because there are cases where the analyzer cannot report the package source.
For instance, the analyzer might parse a lock file that doesn't provide this information.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies ADD COLUMN package_source_id;
```

Similar to packages and package versions, package sources are upserted before upserting project dependencies for a completed pipeline.

Before upserting project dependencies when a CI pipeline finishes,
the backend fetches the current package source IDs from the `project_dependencies` table
and compares them to the source IDs of the corresponding dependencies it has in memory (and about to be upserted).
It then creates vulnerability findings for each project dependency where the source is about to change,
and eventually proceeds with the upsert.

### Reporting a package checksum mismatch

Users want to be warned when a project dependency matches a public package,
but the checksum of the dependency doesn't match any distribution of that public package.

When upserting project dependencies after a pipeline completes,
the backend collects the dependencies added to the project,
and uses the package metadata DB to collect metadata on the public package versions matching these dependencies.
It then iterate the dependencies, and creates a vulnerability finding when the checksum of the dependency
doesn't match any checksum of the corresponding package version.

New vulnerability findings created by the backend are false-positives in some cases:
- The dependency is a private package whose name and version match a public package.
- The dependency uses a package distribution or an alternative checksum that isn't tracked in the package metadata DB.

If the package source is being tracked in the `project_dependencies` table,
then this can be leveraged to exclude private packages when comparing the checksums.

## Package metadata

Package metadata usually include the name of the package, a description of its purpose, an author list, a dependency list, etc.

Package metadata can be included in the installable package itself or kept in a separate file.
Also, they might be repeated by the registry hosting the package, and be fetched using the registry API.

Package registries might provide:
- **version metadata** specific to a package version
- **package metadata** that applies to all versions

For instance, the rubygems.org API provides both
[gem methods](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#gem-methods) and
[gem version methods](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#gem-version-methods).

In most cases version metadata are immutable whereas package metadata are not.
For instance, the description, authors, and license of a package might change over time,
but these metadata won't change for a specific package version.

### Tracking Service

We introduce a new service that tracks public packages, looks for specific package metadata, and posts notifications when these metadata change.
Depending on the package registry, the tracking service will either poll the registry API or listen to a feed of events.

In a simple design, the service could track relevant metadata fields in a relational DB.
1. When a package is seen for the first time, the fields being tracked are store in a DB table.
1. When new metadata is available for the same package, these metadata are compared to what's in the DB.
1. If the new value doesn't match the old one, a notification is posted and the DB record is upserted.

If we decide to track a new field, then two metadata updates are required to detect a change of that field, even if the package is already tracked in the DB.
To remove that limitation, the service can store raw metadata coming from package registries in a document database (Object Storage).
When we decide to track a new field, we can process the existing metadata stored in the doc DB to fill up the new DB column corresponding to that field.

The service might use two DB tables to track changes in package metadata and version metadata, respectively.
These tables would be similar to the `packages` and `package_versions` tables of the GitLab backend.
However, the backend only tracks packages and versions used as project dependencies,
and it only stores the information it needs to search for specific dependencies.

The GitLab backend listens to the notifications posted by the tracking service
and reacts by acting on the projects that depend on the package that's updated.
For instance, it might react by creating vulnerability findings in all projects using the updated package.

The tracking service also exposes API endpoints to fetch the fields it extracts from package metadata,
acting as a proxy for the package registries it tracks.

### License Scanning outside of a pipeline

Users want to track licenses used by their project dependencies without running a CI pipeline.
They are aware that running License Scanning outside of a pipeline has limitations,
like not being able to track licenses used by private packages.

To perform License Scanning outside of a pipeline,
the backend extracts package types, names, and versions from the project dependencies
and uses the package Tracking Service API to collect the corresponding licenses.
It then upserts licenses into `software_licenses`,
and inserts records into `project_dependency_licenses` to reflect the licenses that have been found.

Doing License Scanning outside of a pipeline might be inaccurate if the project dependency is a private package
whose type, name, and version match a public package tracked by the Tracking Service.
If the package source of project dependencies are tracked in the relational DB,
then the backend can leverage this information to exclude private packages from the scan.

The backend can leverage the relational DB to list project dependencies
if the branch being scanned is tracked by the `project_dependencies` table.
If this is not the case, then it uses the Dependency Scanning reports or any other document
that lists the project dependencies for the commit being scanned.

### Notifications about package updates

Users want to be notified about important events relative to packages their projects depend on.
In particular, they want to be notified about these events:
- A new major version has been published.
- A new minor version of the major version being used has been published.
- A new patch version of the minor version being used has been published.
- The major version being used has reached end of life.
- The software license has changed.
- The package maintainers have changed.
- The maintainers of the upstream project have changed.

When one of these events occurs, the Tracking Service notifies the GitLab backend,
and the backend reacts by listing all the projects using the updated package,
and creating user notifications for these.

Depending on the event, the backend might exclude projects that are not affected by the package update.
For instance, it won't create notifications for a new minor version 1.2.3 if a project uses version 2.0.0 of the package.

Since creating notifications for all projects depending on an updated package is a long process,
this task might be split up in multiple asynchronous jobs.
For instance, there could be one job per namespace and/or one job per project.

The exact notification messages and how they are delivered to users are to be defined.

### Warnings about yanked packages

Users want to be warned when a package their projects depend on has been yanked from the package registry.
This warning shows up as a new vulnerability finding listed in the security dashboard.

When a package is yanked from a package registry, the Tracking Service notifies the GitLab backend,
and the backend reacts by creating vulnerability findings in all projects that depend on the same package type and name.
Similarly, when it's notified about a yanked package version,
the backend creates vulnerability findings in projects that depend on the exact same package type, name, and version.

Since creating vulnerability findings for all projects depending on a yanked package is a long process,
this task might be split up in multiple asynchronous jobs.
For instance, there could be one job per namespace and/or one job per project.

The vulnerability finding created by the backend might be a false-positive
when the package or version yanked from the public registry matches a private package the project depends on.
However, the private package might be fetched from a registry that mirrors the public registry, so the finding might still be relevant.

## Package score

Some services provide metrics on public packages, like a score that measures the quality and health of a package.
Like the package registries, they provide package metadata that can be tracked using the Tracking Service.

GitLab could either rely on existing package scoring services or create its own scoring service;
in both cases the Tracking Service notifies the backend about a score change in the exact same way.

### Warnings about score going down

Users want to be notified when the score of a package they use as a project dependency goes down.

When the package score goes down (like from B to C), the Tracking Service notifies the GitLab backend,
and the backend reacts by listing all the projects using the updated package,
and creating user notifications for these.
This is similar to sending notifications about a metadata that has changed on the package registry.

## Security advisories

A security advisory describes a vulnerability that applies to specific versions of a package.
Unlike ordinary package metadata, security advisories associated to a given package version do change:
- A new security advisory can affect a package version at any time.
- An existing advisory might be updated. For instance, its CVSS score might change.
- An existing advisory might be removed because it no longer affects the version.

Security advisories can be provided by [The GitLab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/),
the vulnerability database maintained by GitLab,
or by other vulnerability databases, like [ruby-advisory-db](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db).

### Tracking vulnerability databases

In order to support multiple vulnerability databases,
we introduce a new service that tracks these databases and notifies listeners about two kinds of events:
- A security advisory has been added to a vulnerability database.
- An important field of an existing advisory has changed.

The tracking service also acts as a proxy for the vulnerability databases:
it exposes an API endpoint that returns the security advisories for any package identified by a type, a name, and a version.

If GitLab only uses its own vulnerability database, then there are two possible architectures:
- The tracking service is built on top of the [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/) git repo,
  and it uses web hooks to react in real-time when YAML files are added or modified.
- [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/) is replaced by a service that hosts the security advisories.
  It behaves like the tracking service and notifies listeners about new advisories and advisory updates.

### Dependency Scanning outside of a pipeline

Users want to scan their project dependencies without running a CI pipeline.
They are aware of limitations, like not being able to scan projects that have no lock files.

When running outside of a pipeline, Dependency Scanning relies on reports that list project dependencies.
These reports could either be the existing Dependency Scanning reports or some kind of SBoM artifacts.
In the future, the Rails backend could also process the lock files or dependency exports directly,
removing the need for CI jobs that list project dependencies.

To perform Dependency Scanning outside of a pipeline, the backend proceeds in 4 steps:
1. extract the package types, names, and versions from the project dependencies being scanned
1. connect to the advisory database API or tracking service API to collect the advisories that match the package types and names
1. evaluates the affected version range of each advisory; dependencies that use a version that's not in range are not affected
1. create vulnerability findings for each affected dependency

When creating vulnerability findings, the backend combines:
- information specific to the affected dependency, like the package version and the file where the dependency is declared
- generic information coming from the security advisory, like a description of the security flaw, the CVE id, or the CVSS vector

In a mixed enviroment where Dependency Scanning can be performed by both the backend and scanning jobs,
the backend must set the vulnerability finding fingerprint,
so that it matches the fingerprint of the same vulnerability reported by a scanning job.
If the fingerprints don't match, then the vulnerability detected by the backend
will then be marked as `no longer detected` after a pipeline with Dependency Scanning jobs finishes.

Performing Dependency Scanning outside of a pipeline might lead to false-positives if the project dependency is a private package
whose type and name match a public package for which there's a security advisory.
However, this private package might be fetched from a registry that mirrors the public registry, so the vulnerability finding might still be relevant.

When running on the CI, Dependency Scanning can benefit from post-analyzers
that cross check Dependency Scanning reports with other reports in order to flag false-positives.
If that's the case, then Dependency Scanning won't benefit from these post-analyzers when running outside of a pipeline,
and it might report false-positives.

The backend can leverage the relational DB to list project dependencies
if the branch being scanned is tracked by the `project_dependencies` table.
If this is not the case, then it uses the Dependency Scanning reports or any other document
that lists the project dependencies for the commit being scanned.

When running outside of a pipeline, Dependency Scanning should support all the filters it supports when running on the CI.
In particular, it should be capable of excluding development dependencies from the scan when this is supported by the Dependency Scanning CI job.
Today scan filters are configured using CI variables, and these are not directly available to the Rails backend,
so we might move scan filter settings to project settings.

### Warnings about new security advisories

Users want to be warned about new security advisories affecting their project dependencies without running a new CI pipeline.
They receive a notification, and a new vulnerability finding appears in their security dashboard.
They are aware that this finding might not be as accurate as the ones reported by a Dependency Scanning CI job,
and that this might be a false-positive.

When a new security advisory is added to a vulnerability database, the GitLab backend is notified and it responds in 4 steps:
1. It lists all the projects using the affected package as a dependency, based on its package type and name.
1. It evaluates the range of the affected versions, and filters out the projects using a package version that's not affected.
1. It creates vulnerability findings in all remaining projects.
1. Finally, it creates user notifications for these new vulnerabilities.

Since creating vulnerability findings and user notifications for all affected projects is a long process,
this task might be split up in multiple asynchronous jobs.
For instance, there would be one job per project that depends on the affected package.
The job would follow steps:
1. evaluate the affected version range, and exit if the project doesn't depend on any affected version
1. create vulnerability findings for all project dependencies that match the affected version range
1. create notifications for all users who have notifications enabled for that project

The backend uses the relational DB to efficiently list all the project dependencies that match the newly affected package.

### Notifications about updated security advisories

Users want to be notified when a security advisory affecting their project dependencies changes.
In particular, they want to know when the CVSS score changes or when a new fix is available.

When a new security advisory is updated, the GitLab backend is notified about that change,
and it lists all the projects with a primary vulnerability identifier that matches the ID of the security advisory.
It then creates user notifications about this change in all matching projects.

It is assumed that the primary identifier of the Dependency Scanning vulnerability finding is the ID of the security advisory, like the CVE ID.
This identifier is tracked in the existing `primary_identifier_id` column of the `vulnerability_occurrences` table.

To find projects affected by the updated advisory,
the backend performs a SQL query that joins `projects`, `vulnerability_occurrences` and `vulnerability_identifiers`.
The two last tables are joined on `vulnerability_occurrences.primary_identifier_id`.
If the advisory has a CVE ID, then query is filtered on identifiers WHERE `vulnerability_identifiers.external_type` is `cve`
and where `vulnerability_identifiers.external_type` equals the CVE id.

The query that lists matching projects uses the existing index on `vulnerability_occurrences.primary_identifier`.
To make it efficient, a composite index on `vulnerability_identifiers.external_type` and `vulnerability_identifiers.external_name` is also needed.

## Software of Bill of Materials

A Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) is a document that lists components in a piece of software.
The components are identified using URLs, sets of coordinates, or some other kind of IDs.
Components might have additional metadata like a list of authors, URLs, licenses, security advisories, etc.
The document usually describes both the software for which the SBoM was created and the tool used to create the SBoM.

In this document we focus on application-level packages detected by Dependency Scanning and License Scanning
even though SBoMs can also list system-level packages detected by Container Scanning
or components tracked manually and not detected by scanners.

There are many different SBoM formats but this document focuses on [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
because it is comprehensive, extensible, and well supported by open source libraries and automation tools.

### CycloneDX

[CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) can be used for an inventory of components used as project dependencies.
CyloneDX components can be identified using SWID, CPE, or [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) (PURL).
Like the package slug of the [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/) vulnerability database,
the PURL combines the package type, the full package name, and the package version.
PURL also supports non-default package registries or repositories.

Components can be linked to describe a [dependency graph](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#dependency-graph).
Dependencies can either be transient (dependencies of components) or direct (dependencies of the software itself).
Dependencies have no metadata and it's not possible to distinguish development dependencies from production ones.
However, dependency metadata could be supported by extending the CycloneDX format.

Components can have multiple [licenses](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#license-compliance).
A license can be described using a name, a URL, a SPDX identifier, and by quoting the license itself.
SPDX expressions are also supported.

Components can have [external URLs](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#external-references),
and each URL can provide multiple checksums or "hashes".
This can be used to store signatures of package distributions.

SBoM metadata can describe the software for which the inventory was created.
It doesn't seem possible to describe a composite software made of multiple subprojects, like a Gradle multi-project build.
However, there are at least two ways the parent project and its subproject can be described using CycloneDX:
- by describing the subprojects as "components" of the parent project
- by having multiple CycloneDX documents

CycloneDX doesn't track the dependency files being used to do an inventory.
As a result, the SBoM can't be used to redirect users to the file that introduces a component listed in the inventory.
However, there are ways we can circumvent this limitation:
- Use global metadata [properties](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#properties--name-value-store) to track the dependency file (and optional lock file) where the dependencies were detected. It's not possible to track multiple files of the same type though.
- Use component [properties](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#properties--name-value-store) to track the dependency file (and optional lock file) where each dependency was detected. This introduces redundancies but is more flexible.
- Create a CycloneDX extension to accurately describe the dependency files, and how they relate to the components.

The [vulnerability extension](https://cyclonedx.org/ext/vulnerability/)
can be used to embed vulnerabilities in the SBoM and link them to the components.
A vulnerability can have:
- a CVE identifier
- a description
- a source name (like NVD) and URL
- CVSS vectors, base score, etc.
- CWE identifiers
- advisory URLS
- remediations

A vulnerability only has one identifier, and it looks like this has to be a CVE ID. To be checked.
Also, it doesn't seem possible to provide a short description for the vulnerability.

### Internal SBoM

The Internal SBoM (ISBoM) is a document or a set of documents that describe all the dependencies of a project commit.
It must contain all the data needed to generate SBoM exports, render the Dependency List, compare dependencies, and perform new dependency scans on old commits.

The primary goal of the ISBoM is to reduce maintenance cost by introducing a file format that is both comprehensive and extensible;
this way we don't have to maintain adapters for a variety of formats and format versions.
Newer versions of the Rails backend should remain backwards compatible with older versions of the ISBoM,
making it possible to export a new SBoM for an old git commit without running a new CI pipeline.
To achieve that goal, and considering that the SBoM represents a lot of information, the ISBoM is stored as a file (or files) in Object Storage, and not in the relational DB.
Also, the file paths or URLs should be predictable so that the ISBoM can be retrieved without storing a significant amount of information in the relational DB.
To that effect, the ISBoM could either be:
- a single SBoM document that can track multiple dependency files and describe a multi-project repository
- a collection of SBoM documents combined in an archive

The secondary goals are:
- Fast parsing: Project dependencies are efficiently extracted from the ISBoM, with or without graph information. It should be possible to extract project dependencies corresponding to a set of dependency files without parsing the entire ISBoM.
- Efficient Storage: The ISBoM is compressed when it becomes unlikely that this is going to be accessed.

Since it's a long lasting document, the ISBoM should only contain immutable data.
In particular, it might contain license information but it should not contain vulnerabilities detected in project dependencies;
over time vulnerabilities can change and new vulnerabilities can be added, resulting in a vulnerability list that's inaccurate and/or incomplete.

The ISBoM is primarily used to create SBoM exports but it can also be used to support other features
when project dependencies are not tracked in the relational DB:
- compare dependencies between the source branch and the target branch of an MR
- render the Dependency List
- show dependency paths or dependency graphs in the Dependency List
- find new vulnerabilities

For features that only need basic information on project dependencies,
the ISBoM can be used as a fallback when project dependencies are not available in the relational DB for the commit being processed.
(It's assumed that it's faster to retrieve these information from the DB tables.)
In this case, the ISBoM can be used to fill the DB tables, to later use these tables as a cache.

If the scanning jobs don't provide the information needed to export the SBoM,
then this information should be retrieved from external services and added to the ISBoM.
For instance, if license information or the authors list is needed for the SBoM export,
they should be fetched form the registry or repository hosting the package, either directly or via a Tracking Service.
This complicates the creation of the ISBoM but ensures that the ISBoM is complete and can be used directly.

### SBoM as a License Scanning artifact

CycloneDX is a superset of the License Scanning (LS) report format:
- Combined with the package manager, the package name and version (LS) can be converted to a Package URL (CycloneDX).
- License IDs (LS) can be used as SPDX IDs (CycloneDX) if they match the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
- License can have a name and a URL in both formats.

Like CycloneDX, LS reports don't track the dependency files that introduce project dependencies
or the subprojects of a multi-project build/repository.

As a result, the existing License Scanning job can be changed to generate CycloneDX documents.
Conversely, the Rails backend can be changed to use CycloneDX documents instead of the existing LS reports or to support both formats.
However, the fields the backend needs to implement License Scanning features are optional in CycloneDX
and the backend must be able to handle incomplete documents.

### SBoM as a Dependency Scanning artifact

CycloneDX is NOT a superset of the Dependency Scanning (DS) report format:
- It can't track the dependency file that introduces a dependency, either directly or indirectly.
- It can't describe a composite project, like multi-project Gradle build.
- Vulnerabilities can't have a short description (vulnerability name).
- Vulnerabilities can't have alternative identifiers, and it looks like only CVE IDs are supported.

However, it's possible to remove these limitations by extending CycloneDX.
(It might be necessary to generate multiple CycloneDX documents to accurately describe multi-project builds and repositories.)

As a result, the existing Dependency Scanning job can be changed to generate CycloneDX documents,
but these documents won't be as accurate as the original DS report until we write the CycloneDX extensions that fill the gap.

The Rails backend can be changed to use CycloneDX documents instead of the existing DS reports,
but not before extending CycloneDX so that its SBoM accurately tracks dependency files.
We might change the backend to support vulnerabilities that don't have a short description and alternative identifiers; this seems affordable.
However, the backend heavily relies on the dependency file path when rendering the dependency list and when tracking vulnerabilities.

### SBoM exports

Users want to export the SBoM of their projects to the format they use, like CylconeDX.
They might need an SBoM that covers all the projects of a project group, a workspace, or an instance.
If it takes a significant amount of time to generate the SBoM, users need to be notified when it's ready.
Depending on project settings and group settings, SBoM exports are created:
- on user request, for any project commit
- whenever a project release is created
- periodically, for all relevant branches

Technically an SBoM export of a project commit could be created from:
- all the Dependency Scanning and License Scanning reports of the latest successfull pipeline
- the Internal SBoM corresponding to the commit

Using the ISBoM as the input has multiple benefits:
- There's no need to query the CI database to list the CI artifacts.
- There's only one file to retrieve from Object Storage.
- The ISBoM format is more stable compared to the reports used to build it.
- The ISBoM already provides package metadata needed for the SBoM export.
- Overall this is faster, especially when processing a large number of projects.

The SBoM export may consist of multiple SBoM documents combined in an archive.
- The export might cover all the projects of a project group or a workspace, resulting in multiple SBoM documents.
- The GitLab project might be a multi-project repository, and depending on the SBoM format
  it might be necessary to create multiple SBoM documents to do a full inventory.

When the exports consists of multiple SBoM documents,
it is available as a tgz archive or a zip archive, depending on the project settings or group settings.
Compressed archives are convenient to download and they also have a positive impact on storage.

For simplicity, on-demand exports could be limited to a single project
to ensure that it only takes seconds to generate the export.
If quick enough, this task could be handled synchronously,
which simplifies the UI and removes the need for a dedicated Rails worker.

It's assumed that SBoM exports of a project group or workspace take too long to be performed synchronously on demand request,
and that these tasks should be handled by dedicated Rails workers.
Periodic SBoM exports are then performed by periodic Rails jobs.

SBoM exports created asynchronously are stored in Object Storage.
Users might need an SBoM export longer after the corresponding code was published.
- If SBoM exports are created from CI artifacts, then they should have a specific retention policy, and expire later.
- If SBoM exports are created from long lasting ISBoMs, then they can be safely removed to save space.

### SBoM as a release asset

One or multiple SBoM exports are linked to a project release when it's created, depending on the project settings.
The SBoM exports are stored on Object Storage and linked to the release using asset links.
Ideally the feature supports three scenarios:
- The SBoM export is already available when creating the release.
- The SBoM export is in progress, and linked when available.
- There is no SBoM export. The export should be triggered and the SBoM should later be linked when available.

## Explain dependencies using graphs

Users want to know why their project depends on a specific package even though it's not explicitly required;
they want to know the relationship between a transient dependency and dependencies introduced in the dependency files they maintain.
This relationship could be presented in different ways:
- list all the paths that connect the transient dependency to the introduced ones
- show the full dependency graph and highlight nodes and edges that connect the transient dependency to the introduced ones
- show a sub-graph that only includes the transient dependency and the introduced dependencies connected to it

A single project might have multiple dependency graphs, and these might be stored in multiple artifacts generated by one or multiple scanning jobs.
- Depending on the report format being used, multiple documents might be necessary to describe all the dependencies of a multi-project repository or build.
- When a repository uses multiple package managers, it might be processed by multiple scanning jobs, resulting in multiple CI artifacts.

That said, users only want to know how one specific transient dependency is connected to introduced dependencies,
and a single dependency graph is sufficient to answer that question;
the information can be retreived from a single Dependency Scanning report or SBoM artifact.

The implementation is mostly the same independently of what is presented in the UI.
1. The frontend asks the sub-graph for a package name, package version, dependency file path, commit SHA, and project ID.
1. If the sub-graph is highlighted in the graph, then the frontend also requests the full graph for a file, commit, and project.
1. The backend fetches the CI artifact corresponding to the file, commit, and project.
1. The backend builds the full dependency graph and calculates the sub-graph.
1. The backend returns the sub-graph, a list of paths, or whatever the frontend needs to explain the transient dependency.

Frontend could use GraphQL to query the graph.

If users explore one specific transient dependency, it becomes likely that they explore other transient dependencies of the same file, commit, and project.
As an optimization, the backend should then cache the corresponding dependency graph, so that these steps are not repeated:
1. List the CI artifacts and find the one corresponding to a dependency file, commit, and project.
1. Parse the CI artifact being found and extract graph information.

Alternatively, dependency graph information could be fetched from the ISBoM.
If that's the case, then the ISBoM format should be optimized to efficiently retrieve the graph for a specific dependency file
without parsing and loading in memory the entire ISBoM.

## Group vulnerabilities by introduced dependencies

Users want to know which dependencies introduced in the editable dependency files are responsible for the vulnerabilities being detected.
To address this, the existing dependency list should group vulnerabilities per introduced dependency.
An introduced dependency is responsible for a vulnerability if it's directly affected or it depends on a package that's affected (a transient dependency).

Transient dependencies might be shared by multiple introduced dependencies,
so there's a N-N relationship between introduced dependencies and vulnerabilities:
- An introduced dependency might have multiple vulnerabilities.
- A vulnerability might be connected to multiple introduced dependencies.

Grouping vulnerabilities by introduced dependencies could be extended to all dependencies,
that is any transient dependency that has dependencies.
For instance, if an introduced dependency A depends on B, and transient dependency B depends on C and D, then we could group:
- vulnerabilities related to A; these are vulnerabilities directly affecting A, B, C, or D
- vulnerabilities related to B; these are vulnerabilities directly affecting B, C, or D

The relationships between the affected dependencies and their ancestors are described by the dependency graph.
The dependency graph is not part of the Dependency Scanning report at the moment,
but the existing report will be replaced, extended, or completed to provide the graph.

To efficiently fetch the introduced dependencies from the relational DB,
we could add a new `introduced` boolean column to the `project_dependencies` table,
and set when upserting project dependencies for the branch being tracked.
The backend fetches and processes the dependency graph to establish whether a dependency is introduced or transient.
The column is NULL if the graph isn't available. This might be because of limitations in the analyzer or in the dependency files they parse.

```sql
ALTER TABLE project_dependencies ADD COLUMN introduced boolean;
```

To prepare a list of introduced dependencies along with all related vulnerabilities,
the backend proceeds in 4 steps:
1. fetch introduced project dependencies from the relational DB, possibly using `project_dependencies.introduced`
1. load corresponding dependency graphs from Object Storage
1. fetch vulnerability findings for the same project branch
1. build a dependency map that connects the affected dependencies to the introduced dependencies
1. group the vulnerability findings per introduced using the dependency map

The dependency list could be limited to the dependencies introduced in one specific file, like `api/Gemfile`.
This would make the backend more efficient:
- It fetches the project dependencies matching that file when querying the relational DB.
- It fetches all vulnerability findings for the project branch, but it doesn't keep in memory the findings where the `location` doesn't match the file.
- It only loads and processes the dependency graph corresponding to the file.

Technically, `api/Gemfile` could be resolved to `api/Gemfile.lock` if this is the only file we track in the `project_dependency_files` table.

The dependency map used to resolve affected transient dependency to introduced dependencies could be cached for performance.
The scope of the cache would be the project commit and the set of dependency files for which the map was generated.
