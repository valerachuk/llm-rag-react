## Iteration

We held an Iteration Retrospective in April 2020 in order to review past work and discuss how we could improve iteration for upcoming efforts.

- [Frontend: Iteration Retrospective (Source Code)](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/create-stage/source-code/-/issues/22)

Some overal conclusions/improvements

- Despite having improved the splitting of Merge Requests, we still tend to keep one issue spawning multiple Merge Requests.
- We'll be more strict about splitting the issues in foreseeable iteration steps upon scheduling/assignment
- We must keep in mind the overhead in review times when splitting up related backstage work. ([more info](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/create-stage/source-code/-/issues/22#note_342547093))

## Work

See the [work section](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/code-review/#work) of the main Code Review page.

## Kickoff

On the first week of every milestone, we have a sync-call with every IC in which they take turns at presenting their plan for their Deliverables for the new milestone.

This usually happens at the first Thursday of the milestone (at least 5 days into it) at 3PM UTC.
