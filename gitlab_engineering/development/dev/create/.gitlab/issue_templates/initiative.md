# Overview
### Description
Provide a concise description that outlines why the initiative exists (**purpose**), what specific achievements it aims for (**goals**), and why it holds significance or value (**importance**). The goal is to communicate the initiative's essence, objectives, and the broader impact it seeks to achieve. 
### Stakeholders
Stakeholders, external entities like Customer Success, Customer Support, and Marketing Leads, provide input and represent broader business needs. In contrast, the Team, comprising internal members such as Tech Lead, Engineers, and Product Managers, is actively engaged in executing tasks and achieving the goals of the initiative. Recognizing the distinction is crucial for clear communication, avoiding role overlap, and fostering effective collaboration as stakeholders guide the initiative's strategic direction, while the Team focuses on hands-on implementation, contributing to the initiative's overall success.

# Objectives
This initiatives objectives are tied to GitLab OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) through the alignment of this initiave's goals with broader organizational objectives. GitLab's OKR framework typically includes high-level objectives that align with the company's strategic priorities. These objectives, on the other hand, are more granular and are designed to contribute to the achievement of these higher-level OKRs. Each Initiative should have at least 1 related OKR.

# Communication Plan
## Effective Communication Channels
- **Team Meetings:**
 - Regularly scheduled meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks.
 - **Frequency:** Weekly on Mondays at 10 AM UTC.
 - **Agenda:** Link to Doc.

- **Slack Channel:**
 - Dedicated Slack channel for ad hoc communication, quick questions, and announcements.
 - Team members are encouraged to use `@mentions` for specific communication.

- **Status Report Issues:**
 - Create an issue in the project repository for reporting status updates, achievements, and challenges. You can create either one issue ([1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/create-stage/ide/-/issues/85), [2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361755#note_975547547)) that is updated at a specific cadence or different issues for every update ([1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/create-stage/code-creation/announcements/-/issues/?sort=title_asc&state=all&first_page_size=20),2,3). Some people prefer to post status reports in Slack, however, the problem with that is that you lose the history in Slack and it is not easy to search.
The preference is to use get with the product and dog food the product and then you can link from Slack to the GitLab issue.
 - Link to Issue Board / Issue Lists
 - Link to Issue Lists
 - **Feedback Gathering Epic:**
 - Link to an epic dedicated to gathering internal and external feedback.
 - Regularly check for feedback on features, user experience, and overall progress.
