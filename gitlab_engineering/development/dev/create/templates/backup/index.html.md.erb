## Creating an Out of Office Back Up Plan

If you will be out of the office for a week or more then it is a good idea to create a Back Up Plan and share that plan with impacted team members.

## Creating a Plan

This [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jBK4XBW_2J__QmdtJ-zCdUAy6c5AoUvlbJa-D4eOQ08/edit#) is a recommended template for documenting your Back Up Plan.  If you would like to create your own format, feel free to do so.

## Content

The goal of this plan is to ensure that in your absence someone steps in to take over your responsibilities and normal day to day activities.  Also remember to include a back up for emergencies or incidents that arise.  This will ensure that while you are out, you will have no worries.

## Communication

1. Discuss responsibilities with each Back Up Team Member ensuring they are   comfortable with everything and understand the responsibilities they will be taking on.   
1. Complete this document at least 1 week before your departure and share with the team.  Sharing early gives you the opportunity to add items brought to your attention that you might have left out
1. Create a Slack Channel for all of the Back up Team Members so that they can communicate with each other if needed. The channel can also be used to track outstanding questions or comments for you to address upon your return. (optional)
1. Sharing this document
   * Share this document with your entire team, including stable counterparts and manager
   * Make this document the description of your Back Up Plan Slack Channel
