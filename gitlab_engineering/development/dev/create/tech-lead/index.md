## Responsibilities
The Tech Lead responsibilites are outlined [here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ic-leadership/tech-lead/#responsibilities-of-a-tech-lead).


## Process


### Determine if the Project needs a Tech Lead

In some projects, having a Tech Lead depends on the team's available capacity. Engineering Managers decide based on the team's Tech Leadership capacity. Use these questions to help evaluate if your project needs a Tech Lead.
1. Is the project technically complex? Does it require a blueprint?
1. Does it involve multiple technologies or integrations?
1. Does the project demand unique technical expertise?
1. Does the project have a high level of risk associated with technical aspects?
1. Is the success of the project critical to the overall business goals?
1. Are there complex technical decisions to be made during the project?
1. Does the project involve architectural choices that need experienced guidance?
1. Is there a tight deadline for project completion?
1. Is there a need for effective communication between technical and non-technical team members?

### Appointing a Tech Lead for a Project
