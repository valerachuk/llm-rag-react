## Core Responsibilities

A lot of the terms we use in this area sound similiar and can be confusing at first. Here are the basic basic terms:

- **Code Creation**: The group name and a collection of features relating to providing AI generated code
- **Code Suggestions**: A feature within Code Creation that provides AI-generated code within an IDE
   - **Code Completion**: A short AI-generated suggestion intended to complete an existing line or block of code
   - **Code Generation**: A longer AI-generated suggestion intended to create entire functions, classes, code blocks, etc.
- **Duo Chat**: Another feature that interacts with GitLab Duo Chat to write new code, refactor existing code, or scan code for vulnerabilities

If it helps, here are these terms in a diagram:

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    direction LR
    
    state "Code Creation" as creation
    state "Code Suggestions" as suggestions
    state "Code Completion" as completion
    state "Code Generation" as generation
    state "Duo Chat Features" as duo

    creation --> suggestions
    creation --> duo
    suggestions --> completion
    suggestions --> generation
```

## Engineering Onboarding

To help get started as a developer with the Create:Code Creation team, we have created an
[onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/create-stage/code-creation/team-tasks/-/issues/new?issuable_template=developer_onboarding).

## Meetings

**Sync: Code Creation** - a meeting held once a week on Tuesday at 15:00 UTC to align on group priorities. If there are no points on the meeting agenda one hour before the meeting starts, that meeting is considered as canceled.

All of our meetings and videos are uploaded to the [Code Creation YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KoZOUC-DfaJOzFb6w6hG198). Some meetings are marked as private, so internal team members will need to swtich to use the [Unfiltered YouTube account](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/#unable-to-view-a-video-on-youtube).
