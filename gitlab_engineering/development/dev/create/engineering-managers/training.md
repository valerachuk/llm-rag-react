# What training do we recommend for Engineering Managers?

## CREDIT Values
At GitLab we see **CREDIT** everywhere, it is in our 360 Feedback, Annual and Mid Year Performance Reviews and in Promotion Documents.  
It is important to have evidence for this CREDIT but the training below provides opportunities to learn more about how   
Engineering Managers can live our CREDIT values.
