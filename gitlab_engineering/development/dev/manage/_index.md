title: Manage Stage

## Manage

The responsibilities of this stage are described by the [Manage product category](/handbook/product/categories/#manage-stage).
Manage is made up of multiple groups, each with their own features and areas of responsibility.

* I have a question. Who do I ask?

In GitLab issues, questions should start by @ mentioning the relevant Product Manager for the [product category](/handbook/product/categories/#manage-stage). 

GitLab team members can also use [#s_manage](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CBFCUM0RX).

## How we work

* In accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values/).
* Transparently: nearly everything is public, we record/livestream meetings whenever possible.
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on.
* Everyone can contribute; no silos.
  * The goal is to have product give engineering and design the opportunity to be involved with direction and issue definition from the very beginning.

## OKRs

For a list of active OKRs, [check the OKR project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=devops%3A%3Amanage&milestone_title=Started&first_page_size=50).

## Direction

The direction and strategy for Manage is documented on [https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/). This page (and the category direction
pages under the "Categories" header) is the single source of truth on where we're going and why.
* Direction pages should be reviewed regularly by Product. When updating these pages, please CC the relevant group to keep your teammates informed.
* Product should make sure that their groups understand the direction and have an opportunity to contribute to it. Consider a monthly direction AMA for your group to field questions.

## Career Development

### Giving / receiving feedback

It can be hard to understand how you're doing in your role, because feedback can come off as formal (annual reviews, 360 surveys, career development conversations, goal check-ins) or casual (in Slack channels, 1-1's, MR reviews, team meetings.) We receive various kinds of feedback regularly and through different formats, so the type of feedback you're receiving is not always clear. In order to be more intentional about the types of feedback given, here is a classification chart based on [three types of feedback](https://forimpact.org/three-types-feedback/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFeedback%20comes%20in%20three%20forms,about%20relationship%20and%20human%20connection.):

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **(appreciation)** | I want to thank you for doing this, and please do more of it in the future | "I did not expect that you would have created a working group, because you've done so, our whole team will benefit from the results." |
| **(coaching)** | I'm trying to help you improve a behavior you are already exhibiting or change a behavior that you currently have | "The reports that you give me are very helpful, and in the future we can schedule them for the first of the month to be more consistent." |
| **(evaluation)** | Tells you where you stand according to existing standards or expectations | "My expectation was that our decision would be transparent. Since it was not, our team has forgotten the decision, so we must be sure and meet that expectation next time." |

## Holiday Gift Exchange (2023)

We will kick off the holiday season on December 8 by _optionally_ participating in a Secret Santa exchange - an exchange where a group of colleagues will exchange holiday presents anonymously with each member of the group being assigned to another member to provide a small gift.
1. The exchange amount will be $30 USD, including shipping and tax fees. This amount cannot be expensed and would need to be paid for out of pocket. Team members are not required to participate.
1. [A form has been provided](https://forms.gle/NXCXbWWWbF2HeSk4A) to sign up. This form will include ideal gift ideas for yourself, as well as your formatted mailing address, and local / online stores to choose your gift from.
1. The form will close on December 13. At this time, your Secret Santa will be randomly selected and you will be given the name of a team member to buy a gift for, their ideal gift idea and local buying options if available.
1. Your address will not be shared with anyone other than the person sending your gift, and the organizer (@wortschi).

## Meetings

Although we have a bias for asynchronous communication, synchronous meetings are necessary and should adhere to our [communication guidelines](/handbook/communication/#video-calls). Some regular meetings that take place in Manage are:

| Frequency | Meeting                              | DRI         | Possible topics                                                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Every other Monday | Engineering managers discussion | @m_gill | Ideas, help or resources needed from others, concerns, questions, etc.                                 |
| Monthly   | Stage-level social call              | @mksionek     | Getting to know each other                                                                             |


For one-off, topic specific meetings, please always consider recording these calls and sharing them (or taking notes in a [publicly available document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE8udlwjAiMjZW4p1yARUPNmBgHYReK4Ks5xOJW6Tdw/edit)).

Agenda documents and recordings can be placed in the [shared Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ALpc3GhrDkKwUk9PVA) (internal only) as a single source of truth.

All meetings should have an agenda prepared at least 12 hours in advance. If this is not the case, you are not obligated to attend the meeting. Consider meetings canceled if they do not have an agenda by the start time of the meeting.
