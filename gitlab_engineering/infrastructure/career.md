## Career Development Discovery & Planning

There are a number of tools we use to plot and manage career development:

* [Role descriptions](/job-families/engineering/infrastructure/), which outline role responsibilities, requirements and nice-to-haves for each level in the role.
* Big Picture Career Conversations
* Quarterly checkpoints
* 1:1s
* [360 Feedback](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/)
* [Talent Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/)

Maintaining current [role descriptions](/job-families/engineering/infrastructure/) which establish expectations for hiring and ongoing performance expectations is an important supporting function for effective Career Development planning.

The rest of the tools are for active engagement by the Team Member along with their Manager. The origin activity for this is the Big Picture Career Conversation, followed up with quarterly checkpoints and frequent 1:1s. Finally, 360 Feedback and Talent Assessment provide annual opportunities for additional insight on progress.

### Big Picture Career Conversation
  * Managers should endeavor to have a bigger picture career conversation at least once to set the tone and direction for subsequent Quarterly Checkpoints. There are many ways to have career conversations, and no one way will be a great fit for all team members, so use your best judgment in what type of framework to apply to each of your direct reports. It can be as simple as "Have you set any career goals for yourself?"

  * Here is one example of a big picture framework to guide the conversation in cases where team members could use some coaching:
    1. "Tell me about yourself; what's important to you?"
      - The goal in this section is to get to know your DR's path to how they arrived here, with the specific purpose of uncovering what matters most to them. Ask further questions, especially around pivotal moments or choice points. What had them choose this thing over that? At the end of this conversation you should crystallize 3-4 core values and confirm that these feel accurate.
    2. "What do you see yourself doing at the pinnacle of your career?"
      - The goal in this section is to capture their highest aspirations, at GitLab and beyond. This can be challenging to answer for some people who have never been asked this before. You can prompt them by asking further questions like:
        1. What do you spend your day doing?
        1. Who are you working with?
        1. What size company are you working at?
        1. What industry are you workinng in?
        1. Are you a high level IC or a high level manager? (this might require painting a picture of what each of those might look like)
      - Tie in the answers from the previous section, reflecting how their pinnacle relates to their core values.
      - This becomes the Lighthouse, or the guide post, for any subsequent conversations and action items.
    3. "Where are you now?" Contrast the Lighthouse position with their current position.
      - This can help highlight and skills gaps or areas of development.
      - "Describe to me your current role as you see it?"
      -  "What are your strengths? Weaknesses?"
    4. Action Item plan in 4 part using SMART goals
        1. Growing your Network - Identify people who can get you further along the path.
        -  This includes mentors and sponsors both inside and outside GitLab.
        2. Role Development - what can you do in your current role that will help you move toward your Lighthouse?
        3. Immediate Next Step - identify the logical next step en route to your dream role.
        - This is often the next level of their current role's track (ex SRE to Sr SRE), but depending on what was uncovered in their Lighthouse perhaps it's actually a lateral move (ex Staff SRE to Engineering Manager).
        4. Learning - what courses, trainings or projects can move you towards your dream role? (aim for 10% of your time)
  * After a big picture conversation, you can touch on the values and Lighthouse position in the Quarterly Checkpoints to see if anything has changed.

### Quarterly Checkpoints
  * On the first 1:1 meeting of the quarter, discuss the EFW and select two or three role responsibility areas to focus on during the quarter. Make a note of them in the 1:1 document and add them to the standing agenda. For each area, outline specific goals and targets to achieve, as well as ideas to work on them.
  * On the last 1:1 meeting of the quarter, discuss and record a summary of the progress made for the quarter and update the EFW accordingly.

### 1:1s
  * Mentor on the focus areas in weekly 1:1s at a frequency that feels right for the tasks. There is no hard rule to discuss the career development items every week, but try to do so regularly and avoid a wide-open, ad-hoc conversation.

There is no rule that guides the amount of progress that should be made in a given time-period in a strict fashion. We should however strive to set targets to progress to the [next level](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#introduction) on at least a quarterly basis.

### [360 Feedback](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/)
  * Actions to make changes to a GitLab team-member's level can be taken during the [360 Feedback](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/), and the data collected throughout this workflow should be useful at that time.

### [Talent Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/)
  * The annual company [Talent Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/) event provides another opportunity to gain insight on progress towards both near-term and longer, lighthouse goals.


## Manager Role In Career Development

You must prepare to provide mentoring and guidance on focus areas for the quarter, especially in terms of how to improve and evolve in said areas. Do not hesitate to ask for help if you feel you need guidance to assess strategies for mentorship, and feel free to reach out to the other GitLab team-members who can provide said guidance. Be clear and concise in setting expectations, trying to align them with work that will take place during the quarter.

## Individual Contributor Role in Career Development

Think about the areas that are important to you and commit to working on them over the quarter. Keep an open mind to receive feedback and guidance on these areas, and be an active participant in the process.

## Career Development Guidelines and Considerations

Career development requires that all parties involved be committed to the process and are active participants.

One implicit area to focus on explicitly is **communication**. Regardless of your role, whether technical or manager, you must be a good communicator, and thus, it is important to always improve our communication skills.

While there is no time-boxing for level progress, the company does operate on a [specific cycle](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/) to make changes to a GitLab team-members level during the [360 Feedback](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/).

## Interning with Infrastructure / Reliability Engineering

Cross reference for [Internship for Learning](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/internship-for-learning/)

There is a reasonable amount of interest to intern with Infrastructure so we wanted to put a brief landing section in the handbook.  If you are interested in interning with Infrastructure, we would ask that you talk to your current manager and create an issue per the mentioned process.  This can help us track who is helping on what and what they would like to learn.  Mention the Reliability Engineering team members and managers to help us know you are interested.  One note, in some cases, you may need to submit access-requests to get access to certain systems to help with work.

Don't know what to learn? Check out the [SRE I](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SRE%20Introduction.md) and the [SRE II](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SRE%20II.md) Training Modules, these cover a range of topics related to how we do Reliability Engineering at GitLab. It is recommended that you come to your internship prepared, and by completing both modules, you'll ensure a richer internship experience as you'll make the best use of your time during your internship with an extra focus on more advanced topics.

Additionally, we have a broad set of technical skills listed in the [job description for SRE](/job-families/engineering/infrastructure/site-reliability-engineer/), if you are looking for ideas on what to learn, set up a coffee chat with a team member or one of the managers.
If you're interested in learning more about SREs in general, you may wish to read Alice Goldfuss's blog post, "[How to Get Into SRE](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/how-to-get-into-sre/)." This blog post is an overview of all sorts of SRE related things, some of which may not be in use here at GitLab. However, it can be a valuable tool to learn more about SREs in general, and it links to many resources that you can use to learn more about a variety of SRE related topics.

Specific ways to work in the internship:
1.  Pair up with an engineer on a particular issue or for our project work in OKRs.
2.  Shadow the On-Call in your similar timezone for 2 weeks
3.  Shadow the Delivery team to learn more about how we release to GitLab.com

## Staff+ IC Gearing in Infrastructure
GitLab Engineering employs a gearing method for determining the reporting relationship and number of Staff+ roles, generally referred to as [Staff+ IC Gearing Ratios](/handbook/engineering/career-development).

### Site Reliability Teams IC Gearing
The IC Gearing policy does not require any documentation for use of the default 1:1 ratio of Staff Engineer to team. However, to ensure clarity, the SRE teams within Infrastructure will use this default ratio, providing an opportunity for a Staff Engineer to be a part of each SRE team. As Infrastructure continues to grow and add more teams, additional opportunities for Staff level SRE leaders will be created.

### Delivery Team IC Gearing
**Exception Ratio**: 3 Staff Eng:Team

**Justification**: The Delivery team is tasked with making it increasingly safe and efficient for work product from all of GitLab to make its way to the production environment as well as into the monthly release, patch releases, and security releases. This is an area with continuing needs for additional automation as well as a wide scope of skills and experience.
The Delivery team requires multiple Staff Engineers with two frequently working in the [Solver archetype](/handbook/engineering/ic-leadership/#solver) on parallel issues (or staggered releases), while a third engages in an [Architect archetype](/handbook/engineering/ic-leadership/#architect) in moving automation and/or other CI/CD iterations forward.

**Future Growth or Anticipated Change**: It is expected that during FY22-FY23 two overall changes will influence the gearing ratio.
1. Increasing requirements for patch releases and complexity in overall release process will drive the creation of a second Delivery team
1. Maturity, efficiency, and automation of the CI/CD process will reach a level where there will remain much recurring process work, but a reduction in the large-scale architectural improvements by both Delivery teams.

As a result of the above it is expected that within the FY22-FY23 we will reach a point where each delivery team will reduce to a ratio of 2 Staff Eng:Team.

### Scalability Team IC Gearing
**Exception Ratio**: 2 Staff Eng:Team

**Justification**: The Scalability team is tasked with creating improvements for the highest priority scaling items, primarily in support of the GitLab SaaS service. The team regularly shifts from one area of product or platform to another and a wide range of backend and infrastructure experience and skills are required. Additionally, a keen mind for high level architecture and an understanding of product workflow are essential for success. The team generally has a scaling item they are currently working on as well as another item that is being evaluated for the next iteration. In this model the two Staff Engineers individually employ both [Architect and Solver archetypes](/handbook/engineering/ic-leadership/#the-four-archetypes-at-gitlab) towards their primary scaling item currently in focus.

**Future Growth or Anticipated Change**: It is expected that the team will continue to work in the current fashion where each Staff Engineer is providing technical leadership on parallel issues. In addition, it is expected that an additional 1-2 Scalability teams will be required in FY22-FY23 timeframe and likely that they will adopt the same model and Staff Eng ratio of 2 Staff Eng:Team.
