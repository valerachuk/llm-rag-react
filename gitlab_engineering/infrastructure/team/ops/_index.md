## Mission

The Ops team is an infrastructure team under SaaS Platforms that focuses on improving processes that are vital to the succesful operations of Gitlab.

## Vision

Ops exists to ensure that all services at GitLab are properly supported by either providing that support directly or routing requests for new work to the appropriate [Infrastructure team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team) while also being the primary operators and maintainers of the GitLab.com application.  In the short-term, the goal is shrink the overall pool of what we call "General" by assigning ownership of services to appropriate [Reliability team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team) so that full attention can be paid to the processes, frameworks, architecture and automation required to properly support the GitLab.com application in the long term.

## Ownership and Responsibilities

There are two areas that are the Ops team primary focus:

1. Incident Management - Ops is responsible for improving the processes Gitlab uses for incident management
2. Disaster Recovery - Ops is responsible for managing our disaster recovery processes with a particular focus on reducing our RTO

### Services

The Ops team is assigned issues based on the services they own.  This includes everything labeled `owner: reliability_general` in the [Service Catalog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/services/service-catalog.yml).

#### Overlap

It is not always easy or possible to definitively determine the primary services associated with an issue, incident, or other piece of work.  When there is a lack of clarity, Ops team members should collaborate with other Infrastructure Teams to determine the best path forward.  If necessary reach out to any Infrastructure Engineering Manager for assistance.

#### DBRE Support

The [DBRE team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/database) occasionally requires SRE support which the Ops Team, by default, will provide.

## How We Work - Prioritization

### Issues and Epics

Issues are prioritized utilizing the [Issue Management and Prioritization Process for Reliability](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/ops/#issues-and-epics).  The issues themselves are managed on The [Ops Team Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production-engineering/-/boards/3993753?label_name[]=team%3A%3AOps).   This board is reviewed a minimum of once per week by the Engineering Manager for the Ops Team or by another member of the team if the Engineering Manager is not available.

### OKRs

OKRs are established following the same process for [issue prioritization](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/ops/#issues-and-epics).  In addition to OKRs, a variable percentage of team capacity is reserved each quarter for unplanned work (as the Ops Team will, by default, own any work that does not currently have a pre-defined owner).

### Corrective Actions and Security Issues

`~Severity::1`/`~Severity::2` Corrective Actions and `~reliability::P1`/`~reliability::P2` Security issues are, by default, prioritized over all other types work.
``By default,`~Severity::1`/`~Severity::2` Corrective Actions and `~reliability::P1`/`~reliability::P2` Security issues are prioritized over all other issue types.

### Processes

#### Monthly Availability Updates

The Ops Team is responsible for ensuring the published Monthly Availability Updates are maintained.  This is currently a manual process.   Items to update include:

1. [Historical Service Level Availability](/handbook/engineering/monitoring/#historical-service-level-availability) including [maintenance windows](https://status.gitlab.com/pages/history/5b36dc6502d06804c08349f7) from the month in the comments

Each of these items should be updated to reflect the most recent month.  ([Sample MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/merge_requests/4115)).

Latest results are on the [GitLab.com General SLA Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/general-slas/general-slas?orgId=1&from=now-1M%2FM&to=now-1M%2FM) (internal only)

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Updates must be merged by the 7th day of each month.  This is currently a scheduled event on the Reliability Ops Team's Calendar.  Contact any member of the team for more details on this process.

#### Monthly Review of Incident and Pager Trends

The Ops team coordinates the monthly process to identify incident and pager trends across the engineering organization.  This is an async process with the following objectives:

- Identify actions to address issues identified in the Reliability Team Monthly Availability Reports.
- Generate action items based on the review of key metrics for incidents and pages.
- Generate and delegate action items to the relevant teams based on the review process.  This includes:
   - [Corrective Actions](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#corrective-actions)
   - [Infradev Issues](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#infradev)
   - [Reliability Improvement Issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/new)

These efforts are coordinated asynchronously via the [GitLab Incident and Pager Trends Monthly Review Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBoyuKK_g3RbYMcwJZs6dFqCGH9NCqu-M3QsHIwiKMw/edit#)

The process is scheduled on the Ops Team Calendar to kick off on the first Tuesday of each month.

The DRI kicking off the process and ensuring its progress is rotated among members of the Ops Team.

All our welcome to participate in the process of identifying trends.  EOCs, especially, are encouraged to participate.

1. Week 1: Review the agenda and respond to any questions or comments
1. Week 2: Reply to the announcement thread and solicit additional feedback.
1. Week 2: Review the agenda and respond to any questions or comments
1. Week 3: Review the `Identified Trends` section of the agenda and coordinate the creation of any required Corrective Actions, Infradev Issues, or Infrastructure Improvement Issues.

1. Week 4: Send a final reply to the announcement thread indicating that the process is closed for the month.

## Team Status Updates

The Ops Team provides weekly updates all Epics following the [Reliability Process for Epics](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/ops/#issues-and-epics).

OKRs are updated every Wednesday as required by the [Reliability Process for OKR Updates](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/ops/#okrs)

[Current OKRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?sort=closed_at_desc&state=opened&type%5B%5D=objective&label_name%5B%5D=Reliability%3A%3AGeneral&first_page_size=100)
