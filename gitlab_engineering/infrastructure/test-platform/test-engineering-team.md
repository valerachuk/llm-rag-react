## OKRs 

Every quarter, the team commits to [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](/handbook/company/okrs/). The below shows current quarter OKRs and is updated regularly as the quarter progresses.

Here is an [overview](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/6583) of our current Test Engineering OKRs.

## How we work 

### Project management

#### Iterations

- We plan our work in 2 weeks long iterations
- We maintain and regularly update [Test Engineering team board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/7364900?not[label_name][]=failure%3A%3A*&label_name[]=team%3A%3ATest%20Engineering). This board reflect the actual status of the ongoing work 

#### Issue weights 

We estimate every task during iteration planning. Our weighting strategy is based on [Test Platform Weighting](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/test-platform/#weights) 

| Weight | Description | Approximate time | Example issues | 
|--------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1    	 | Trivial     | ~1 hour    	  | TBD | 
| 2      | Small       | ~0.5-1 day       | TBD |
| 3    	 | Medium      | ~3 days    	  | TBD |
| 5    	 | Large       | ~1 week    	  | TBD |
| 8    	 | X-Large     | ~2 weeks    	  | TBD |
| 13+    | XXL         | >>2 weeks    	  | TBD |

- Approximate  time estimate - is time spent actively working on the issue: from design to requesting the review   
- It is not manadatory to create Trivial tasks 
- Consider breaking down Large tasks into smaller items 
- XL and XXL tasks has to be broken down into smaller tasks and might require creating Spike issue first
