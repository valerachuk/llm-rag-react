title: "Test Platform Roadmap"
description: "Roadmap for the Test Platform Sub-Department at GitLab"
---







# Overview

The Test Platform sub-department roadmap is divided into multiple **[Tracks](#tracks)**.
* Each [track](#tracks) consists of smaller epics or issues.
* Each [track](#tracks) captures the type of work grouped by a theme. Each theme is broken down into categories and phases so they can be worked on in iterations and put on a delivery timeline.
* Each [Track](#tracks) maps directly to a track level epic. [They are labeled with "~Quality" and ending with "track"](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Quality&search=%22track%22)

Whole department roadmap view of all [tracks](#tracks).
* An umbrella epic [Test Platform sub-department Roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1543) shows the timeline of everything.
* This epic is static and should not be edited. It is designed to only contain track level epics.

## Roadmap Management

**Linking epics**
* The [track](#tracks) level epics and the [Test Platform sub-department Roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1543) epic are the only epics allowed to have child epics.
* Each numbered list item in the roadmap should be a link either to an epic or an issue. They should be added to one of the [track](#tracks) level epics.
* Child epics that form a [track](#tracks) should only have issues.
* Epic structure:
  1. Department roadmap.
  1. Tracks.
  1. Everything else.

**Creating new epics**

* In the spirit of keeping things easily discoverable and reducing unnecessary epics, please refrain from creating new epics unless there are 5 or more issues created/scoped for that new epic.
* Please refrain from creating new [tracks](#tracks) level epics unless it is really nessessary.

# Tracks

## [Coverage track](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1459) ([roadmap view](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1459#roadmap))

Work to improve the overall test coverage.

### Testcase Management

A testcase management system to document all E2E tests and their types, and link to test reports.

1. Basic [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RlLfXGboJmNVIPP9jgFV5sXIACGfdcFq1tKd7xnlb74/edit) to plan type of meta data. => Done
1. Use GitLab issues as testcase management using [gitlab-org/quality/testcases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases) project.
1. Integration testcases in [gitlab-org/quality/testcases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases) with automated tests. Rspec reporter that references testcase from code so they can be updated/synced dynamically.
1. Testcase Management as GitLab Native feature. [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/617)

### Cross-browser tests

Issues: [Crossbrowser & Mobile Browser testing coverage and infrastructure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/45)

1. [Basic capability to run on other browsers besides chrome (IE11, Firefox)](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/609).
1. Internet Explorer, and Edge coverage.
1. Other desktop browsers.
1. Mobile browser coverage.
1. Run smoke test on soon to be new stable versions of important browsers to detect issues early.

### Ecosystem tests

Epic: [QA: GitLab 3rd party ecosystem testing](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/661)

1. Basic tests for LDAP and SAML.
1. Github and Google OAuth tests.
1. Jenkins and Jira integration tests.

### Visual-diff tests

Browser screenshot visual testing to catch visual bugs. Helps with validating layout, UX, and accessibility.

Issue: [End-to-end visual regression validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/47).

1. Lean on 3rd party tools to get something running fast and learn from the product.
1. Basic pixel to pixel comparison implemented as part of GitLab.
1. Visual coverage smoke test for all stage groups.
1. Use visual diff as a GitLab Native feature.

### Performance tests

1. Basic functional tests that creates a big issue and merge request. => Done
1. First stress test environment for on-prem customers with test runs and monitoring. => Done
1. Real 10,000 user reference architecture with customer reference traffic load testing.

1. Implement a POC for the ruby and JavaScript code to gather data
1. Data analysis and action items
1. Depends on the above

### Test planning

Test planning process.

1. Roll out testplan format and planning process.
1. Bake in test planning as part of feature planning process.
1. Iterate and come up with a shorter version of the [10 min ACC framework](https://testing.googleblog.com/2011/09/10-minute-test-plan.html).

## [Efficiency track](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1460) ([roadmap view](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1460#roadmap))

Work that increases our efficiency and productivity.

### Fault Tolerance

1. Test retry.
1. Dynamic Page Object locators validation.
1. API client automatically retries on 5xx errors.

### Faster Execution

Running test faster.

1. Basic parallelization via runners.
1. Parallelization at the process level for all E2E tests, exponential cost saving of CI runners.
1. Run all tests at the same time, the whole suite takes only as long as the longest test.
1. Evaluation of a subset of tests instead of running all the E2E tests depending on what changed.
  * Investigate the use of [running jobs when there are changes for a given path](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19232) for GitLab QA jobs.

### API Usage

Use API in all E2E tests. Achieve optimal test layering with API suite more than %60 of total tests.

1. [Use API calls to build the most used resources (Group, Project, User) in tests that are not focused on testing these resources behaviors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/21302). => Done
1. Use API calls in login and logout for smoke tests.
1. Implement API fabrication for all the resources that support it.
1. Use API calls for setting up all resources in every E2E tests. Roll out as a standard for every new test.

### Lean pyramid

Optimize test coverage across the layers of the test pyramid, to remove redundant tests and achieve higher coverage with greater efficiency.

* **Phase 1**: TBD


### Test data

Come up with standardized test data that can be seeded in all environments for productivity.

1. Test data curation, define a test datamodel which is static.
Define better project structure for ease of debugging, more readability in automated test data output, better group, project and issue naming (not just using timestamps).
1. Script to setup testdata and clean them up.
  * Idempotent script based on API calls (E.g. adds project if missing, uses existing if exists).
1. Setup 50% of planned test data from Phase 2 in [GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit), Review Apps, Staging and Canary/Production.
1. Setup 100% of planned test data from Phase 2 in [GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit), Review Apps, Staging and Canary/Production.

### Test results

Work that will allow us to debug tests more easily. Includes better reporting and more informative artifacts.

1. Better readability in test output.
