## OKRs

Every quarter, the team commits to [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](/handbook/company/okrs/). The below shows current quarter OKRs and is updated regularly as the quarter progresses.

Here is an [Overview](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/work_items/4938) of our current Self-Managed Platform team OKR.

## Projects

* [GitLab Performance Tool]
* [GitLab Browser Performance Tool]
* [GitLab Environment Toolkit]
* [Performance Test Data]
* [Performance Docker Images]
* [Zero Downtime Testing Tool]
* [Reference Architectures]

## Working with us

There are occasions where the expertise of the Reference Architecture or Self-Managed Platform team may be needed in support of a customer issue.

For any requests relating to customer environments, either proposed or existing, they must be raised in the [Reference Architectures](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/reference-architectures/-/issues/new) project with the appropriate template. Requests should be opened two or more business days before action is needed to ensure the team has time to prepare and we kindly ask for this process to be followed for tracking and capacity reasons. Any requests made outside of this process such as direct asks to join customer calls or projects will be rejected and should instead be directed to Support or Professional Services accordingly.

For issues specifically with the [GitLab Environment Toolkit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues/new) or [GitLab Performance Tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/-/issues/new) issues can be raised in each respective project.

For individual questions please reach out to the team via our slack channels.

## How we work

### Meetings and Scheduled Calls
Our preference is to work asynchronously, within our projects issues trackers.

The team does have a set of regular synchronous calls:
- Self-Managed Environment Triage
- GitLab Environment ToolKit Bi-Weekly Sync
- 1-1s between the Individual Contributors and Engineering Manager

Stand-up twice per week on Tuesday and Thursday via our teams slack channel

### Project Management

### Issue Boards

### Status Updates 
- By 20:00 UTC / 03:00 PM ET on Fridays DRIs of OKRs to provide a status update in the comment section of the OKR
     - Format for weekly update:
          - Date of Update (YYYY-MM-DD)
          - Brief update (~sentence or couple bullets) for each of these four bullets:
               - Status update - Progress has been updated to X %.    
               - What was done :white_check_mark: - Unblocked blockers, any other progress acheived
               - Next steps :construction_worker: 
               - Blockers :octagonal_sign: - Issues or unexpected work that blocked/affected progress. For example, customer escalations/on-call DRI
- ASYNC Standup on Tuesdays and Thursdays - Reply to GeekBot questionaire on Slack. 

## Test Platform process across product sections:

Overall we follow the same process as [defined](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/test-platform/#how-we-work) in our Test Platform handbook across all groups in Core Platform and SaaS Platform
except for a few exceptions curated to fit the needs of specific groups.
