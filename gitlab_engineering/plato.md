title: "GitLab Plato HQ Mentoring Program"
---

## Program Overview
GitLab has partnered with [Plato HQ](https://www.platohq.com/) for an external Mentoring Program. In this program GitLab team members select Mentors external to GitLab.  Some of the other Mentoring programs we have here at GitLab are internal to GitLab.  [Minorities in Tech](/handbook/company/working-groups/mit-mentoring/) and [Women in Sales](/handbook/people-group/women-in-sales-mentorship-pilot-program/) are both made up of GitLab Mentors and GitLab Mentees.  The external mentoring is what makes this approach to GitLab unique.

For more information on mentoring best practice, visit [Mentoring](/handbook/engineering/career-development/mentoring/).

## How does it work?

1. A GitLab Team Member is recommended by their Manager to participate in the program or can reach out to [Roos Takken](/handbook/company/team/#rtakken) if they are interested in participating.
1. Currently there are 10 seats with Plato. If all filled we will be working with a waiting list for admission. Also team members can leverage their [Growth and Development budget](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#types-of-growth-and-development-reimbursements) to enroll with Plato. 
1. All Mentees are invited to a KickOff Meeting with Plato
1. Mentees select one Mentor after viewing three Mentor Plato Profiles while on a Plato Call 
1. Plato sets up the framework / software to support the Mentoring Relationship
     * Plato schedules meetings and Zoom sessions (that are recorded) 
     * Plato invites Mentees to Seminars where you hear guest speakers from other companies
1. Mentees and Mentors meet (average meeting time is 30 minutes) on a regular cadence (typically twice monthly) based on their preferences
1. Mentees create all of the Agenda and are the main drivers of the relationship
1. If at any point the team member doesn't want to participate anymore they can send an email to Jean-Baptiste Coger of Plato and CC [Roos Takken](/handbook/company/team/#rtakken) to start the offboarding.
