title: "Skillsharing - Frontend"
---

Here we document our efforts of coordinating and facilitating the production of content to improve the sharing of common skills amongst the Frontend groupâ€”maybe even other groups.

Note: These efforts should not be a replacement of technical documentation but an addition.

# How to help?

There are two main ways you can help.

## 1. Creating issues / requests

Create [issues on the project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/skillsharing/issues) of things you'd either like to share with others or things you'd like others to share with you.

This is the best way to document that you're working on something or that you'd like to see particular topics covered by your colleagues.

## 2. Recording and uploading videos

Check the [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/skillsharing/issues) and if you find something you're capable of covering, feel free to go ahead and record yourself explaining it.

Remember to assign yourself to the issue you're working on to avoid duplicated efforts.

### Format

- **Length:** 5-10min (shorter ok but not longer)
